# Chemistry Scientist

## Education

_2018-2024_  **PhD in Chemistry**  [Universidad Nacional de Córdoba](https://www.fcq.unc.edu.ar/), Córdoba, Argentina  

_Thesis_: Effect of lipid environment in the conformation and orientation of the transmembrane-cytoplasmic segments of the integrin αIIbβ3.  

For my PhD, I investigated the interfacial properties of the transmembrane (TM) and intracellular (IC) domains of αIIbβ3 integrin and their interactions with lipid monolayers. My study represents a key advance in the understanding of integrin-lipid interactions, which are critical for cell adhesion and signaling. My findings demonstrate that:  

- Integrin TM-IC segments form stable monolayers, adopting vertical or tilted orientations under compression.  
- Peptides condense lipids in POPC/POPG but expand DPPC, influenced by lipid composition.  
- Peptides alter lipid compressibility, preventing DPPC phase transition and inducing fluid-like behavior.  
- BAM imaging shows strong peptide self-association, disrupted in DPPC but stable in POPC mixtures.  
- _Biological Relevance_: Lipid composition modulates TM integrin segment organization, potentially affecting integrin activation.
